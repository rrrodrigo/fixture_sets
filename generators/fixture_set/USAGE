Fixture Set Generator - Used to create a new fixture set specification. Fixture sets are sandboxed, one off groups
of YAML fixture data generated programmatically from the development or production database. One can also create non-generated
fixture sets by creating the YAML files by hand.

./script/generate fixture_set dashboard
Creates	test/fixture_sets/dashboard/dashboard_fixture_set.rb

Example Fixture Set:
User.active = User.find_by_username('blake')
FixtureSet.new('dashboard') do |set|
	set.spaces = User.active.visitable_spaces
	set.users = [User.active]
	set.pages = Page.with_scope(Scopings.in_my_spaces) { Page.find(:all) }
	set.visits = Visit.find_all_by_user(User.active)
end
